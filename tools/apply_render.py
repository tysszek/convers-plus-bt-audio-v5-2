apply_render.py - patch the BT Audio screen renderer (FUN_0x1ce94) so that title and artist
can be up to 19 characters (instead of the stock 15), WITHOUT changing the frame size (the
epilogue 0x1ce8c is SHARED with the neighbouring function - changing `sub sp` would break it).

This patch only relocates a buffer; the actual character limit is set by the clamp in
apply_patch_v3.py (currently 19, which also matches the Bluetooth module's own truncation).

The bug: the renderer loads the title via a getter into sp+0x40 (a 20-byte buffer, up to
sp+0x54), then NEEDLESSLY copies it with strcpy into the cramped sp+0x64 (16B, right next to
the saved registers at sp+0x74). The artist goes to sp+0x54 (16B, right next to the title at
sp+0x64) and at >=16 chars overflows a NUL into title[0] -> blank title.

The fix: redirect the 5 title references from sp+0x64 to sp+0x40 (title stays in the getter
buffer, 20B -> <=19 chars). The artist at sp+0x54 then has the full 32B up to sp+0x74 (saved
registers), and the title strcpy at 0x1ceda becomes strcpy(sp+0x40, sp+0x40) = a safe no-op
(no write to sp+0x64, so a long title can't overflow into the saved registers either).

  add r0,sp,#0x64  (0xA819)  ->  add r0,sp,#0x40  (0xA810)
  @ 0x1cedc (title strcpy, becomes self-copy), 0x1cefe (empty-title branch),
    0x1cf1a (0x3a320), 0x1cf32 (0x1ccea), 0x1cf4a (0x409ea draw)
