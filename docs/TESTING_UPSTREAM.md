# Testing with injected CAN frames

**Prove the cluster + patch work on their own — without the phone or Bluetooth module.**

The patch only ever displays what arrives on the CAN bus as **ID `0x4B1`, source byte `0x12`**. That metadata is broadcast by the module that handles Bluetooth audio, on the shared **MM MS-CAN** (multimedia) bus. Because it's a broadcast, every node on that bus — the radio/head unit **and** the Convers+ cluster — sees the same frames.

So there are two independent questions when "nothing shows from my phone":

1. **Does my patched cluster display `0x4B1` metadata at all?** → inject known frames and see.
2. **Does my Bluetooth source actually put the metadata on `0x4B1`?** → capture the bus and look.

This page covers #1. If injected frames show up but your phone's don't, the patch is fine and the problem is on the source side (#2) — your BT module / head unit isn't broadcasting `0x4B1`, or is using a different ID.

## Zero-hardware: run it in an emulator

**Before touching the car at all**, you can answer "does the patch work on *my* dump?" on your desk. `tools/emulate.py` loads your firmware into a small ARM emulator, applies the patch to a throw-away copy exactly the way you'd flash it, injects a synthetic Bluetooth metadata frame on `0x4B1` (the same ISO-TP framing the real module sends), runs the **actual cluster code** that handles it, and reads back both the media store and the screen renderer to tell you — in plain language — whether the title/artist reached the display.

No car, no CAN adapter, no PCAN. Your own `main.bin` (the `0x5000`-based code partition) is the only input, and it is never modified.

### What you need

- **Python 3**
- The **Unicorn** CPU emulator:
  ```bash
  pip install unicorn
  ```
- That's it. (`pip install capstone` too, only if you want the `--trace` disassembly.)

### Run it

```bash
python tools/emulate.py --dump main.bin
```

Inject your own text, or test a non-default head-unit ID:

```bash
python tools/emulate.py --dump main.bin --title "PATCH TEST" --artist "CANBUS"
python tools/emulate.py --dump main.bin --canid 0x4C6
```

If you pass a `--canid` the cluster's hardware doesn't accept (see [the CAN-ID section below](#if-your-head-unit-uses-a-different-can-id-experimental)), the tool prints a NOTE: the emulator can still demonstrate it, but the real cluster would filter that ID out before the firmware sees it.

Already flashed your cluster and dumped it back? Point the tool at that dump — it detects the patch is present and tests **exactly what's on the car**, no re-patching:

```bash
python tools/emulate.py --dump my_flashed_cluster.bin
```

### Reading the result

A successful run ends with:

```
  Same 0x4B1 frame, same method, driven through the real hook @0x236f4:

  BEFORE  stock    title=''  artist=''   -> PASS (dropped, as it should be)
  AFTER   patched  title='PATCH TEST'  artist='CANBUS'   -> PASS (reaches the store)
          renderer title='PATCH TEST'  artist='CANBUS'   -> PASS (drawn on screen)
  CONTROL wrong 0x4B0  title=''  artist=''   -> PASS (correctly ignored)

  RESULT: PASS - the patch is what makes the difference: the identical Bluetooth
          frame is DROPPED before patching and REACHES THE SCREEN after ...
```

It's a real before/after, and **all three** must pass:

- **BEFORE** runs the *same* `0x4B1` frame through the *same* real hook site on the **unpatched** firmware — and it must be **dropped** (nothing reaches the store). This is what proves the stock cluster genuinely ignores Bluetooth metadata.
- **AFTER** runs the identical frame on the **patched** image and confirms the title/artist reach the media store *and* the screen renderer.
- **CONTROL** injects the same text on a **non-matching** ID (`0x4B0`, which carries the same Bluetooth text but the patch deliberately ignores) and confirms the store stays **blank** — an anti-false-positive guard.

Because the two images are byte-identical except for the patch (the hook bytes + the code cave), and the run goes through the hook *as installed*, a PASS means the patch itself is what turns "dropped" into "on screen" — not the test harness writing memory. If the stock image had displayed the frame, or a wrong ID had leaked into the store, the run would **fail**. (Given an already-patched dump, the tool reconstructs the stock bytes in memory to run the same before/after.)

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **PASS** | The patch works on your firmware. If your phone still shows nothing in the car, the cluster side is fine — the problem is the **source**: your head unit broadcasts on a different CAN ID. Find it (below) and re-run with `--canid 0xNNN`. |
| **Patch state: UNKNOWN** | The tool couldn't find the expected hook — your firmware **version differs** from the one the patch targets, or the file isn't the `0x5000` code partition. The patch can't be applied as-is; open an issue with your car model, cluster part number and the printed bytes. |
| **FAIL** | The patch applied but the injected text didn't reach the store/renderer in emulation. Please open an issue with the full output. |

This is the fastest way to split the three usual causes of "nothing shows from my phone" — *wrong firmware version* (UNKNOWN), *flash didn't take* (dump the cluster and see `PATCHED` or not), and *source uses a different CAN ID* (PASS here, but nothing on the bus). The hardware tests below confirm the same thing on the real cluster.

## First — the zero-hardware check: does USB metadata show?

Before reaching for a CAN adapter, answer one question: **when you play music from a USB stick, does the cluster show the track title and artist?**

USB metadata is stock functionality, and the patch feeds the Bluetooth text into the *same* media display pipeline the cluster already uses for USB. So:

- **USB titles show** → the cluster's media display works. Whatever's wrong is specific to Bluetooth: either the patch isn't active (flash) or nothing is arriving on `0x4B1` (source). Continue below.
- **USB titles don't show either** → the problem is more fundamental (wrong/faulty cluster, wrong CAN bus, or a variant this patch doesn't target). The Bluetooth patch can't work if the media display itself doesn't. Sort this out first.

If you don't have a USB source to try, the `0x4C7` injection test below is the powered equivalent.

## What you need

- A **PCAN-USB adapter** *or* a cheap compatible clone (the common "PCAN-USB" clones sold for ~$10–15 online work with PEAK's software).
- **[PCAN-View](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-View.242.0.html?&L=1)** — PEAK's free CAN monitor/transmitter for Windows. Installing it also installs the PCAN driver.
- A tap into the car's **MM MS-CAN** (multimedia) bus at **125 kbit/s** — see [Wiring into the bus](#wiring-into-the-bus) just below; the easy way is the OBD-II port.

**Software — you only need what your chosen method uses:**

| Method | Needs |
|---|---|
| **Copy the frame bytes below into PCAN-View** (simplest) | Just PCAN-View. **No Python, no scripts.** |
| **Run `make_test_frames.py` to print frames for custom text** | Python 3 (standard library only — nothing to install). |
| **Run `make_test_frames.py --send` to transmit automatically** | Python 3 **plus** PEAK's [PCAN-Basic API](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-Basic.239.0.html?&L=1): copy its `PCANBasic.py` into the `tools/` folder next to the script (the PCAN driver, installed with PCAN-View, provides the matching `PCANBasic.dll`). |

For the quick tests below, the exact bytes are printed right here — so the zero-Python PCAN-View route is all you need.

> ⚠️ Ignition **on / ACC, car parked**, engine off is fine. Do not do this while driving. You are only adding harmless metadata frames, but treat the CAN bus with respect.

---

## Wiring into the bus

The Bluetooth/USB metadata rides on the **MM MS-CAN** (the multimedia CAN), at **125 kbit/s** — the bus the radio/nav (ACM) and the Convers+ cluster (IPC) share. Note this is a *different* bus from the regular MS-CAN, so use the right pins.

The easiest and safest tap is the **OBD-II (DLC) port** — no need to open the cluster:

| Signal | OBD-II pin |
|---|:--:|
| **MM MS-CAN CAN-H** (metadata) | **pin 1** |
| **MM MS-CAN CAN-L** (metadata) | **pin 8** |
| **Ground — mandatory** | **pin 4** (chassis) or **pin 5** (signal) |

Connect **all three**: adapter CAN-H → pin 1, CAN-L → pin 8, and — this part is **mandatory** — the adapter's **GND → pin 4 or 5**. A USB-CAN adapter (CANable, PCAN clone, etc.) running off a laptop has no shared reference with the car otherwise, and CAN will be unreliable or simply won't work without that common ground.

Set your adapter to **125 kbit/s**. Do **not** add a termination resistor — the bus is already terminated. Ignition on / ACC, car parked.

(For reference, the other buses on the OBD-II port: regular MS-CAN = pins 3/11 @ 125k, HS-CAN = pins 6/14 @ 500k — but the metadata is on MM MS-CAN, pins 1/8.)

## Easiest test — a single frame

Generate the frame:

```bash
python tools/make_test_frames.py --title "OK"
```

It prints something like:

```
CAN ID: 0x4B1   DLC: 8   (MM MS-CAN, 125 kbit/s)

  #  what          data bytes
  -- ------------- -----------------------
   1 title SF      06 46 12 01 01 4F 4B 00
```

In **PCAN-View** (connected at **125 kbit/s**):

1. Go to the **Transmit** tab → **New Message**.
2. ID `4B1`, Length `8`, Data `06 46 12 01 01 4F 4B 00`.
3. Set it to **Cyclic**, period e.g. `200 ms`, and start it.
4. Open the **BT Audio** screen on the cluster.

**Expected:** the title **`OK`** appears within a second. That means the flash took and the patch is working — full stop.

---

## Baseline test — the USB media path (works even on *stock* firmware)

There's a second, deeper test worth knowing. Send the **same data bytes on ID `0x4C7`** (the
factory USB media path) instead of `0x4B1`:

```bash
python tools/make_test_frames.py --title "OK" --id 0x4C7
```
→ `4C7  06 46 12 01 01 4F 4B 00`, sent cyclically in PCAN-View.

Because the source byte is still `0x12`, the cluster routes it into the **BT** store, so the
title shows on the **BT Audio** screen — and this works **even on unpatched firmware**, because
it reuses the media pipeline the cluster already runs for USB. (This is actually the experiment
that proved the whole approach was possible in the first place.)

It's a great baseline: it tells you whether the cluster's BT-screen display path works *at all*,
independently of both the patch and your Bluetooth source. Interpretation:

- **`0x4C7` test shows, `0x4B1` test doesn't** → the display path is fine, but the patch isn't
  active — the flash didn't take or the firmware version differs.
- **Both show** → everything cluster-side is good; a "nothing from my phone" issue is purely the
  Bluetooth source not broadcasting `0x4B1`.
- **Neither shows** → you're likely not on the right CAN bus / bitrate, or this is a cluster
  variant the patch doesn't target.

> Keep `0x4C7` tests to a short (≤ 3-char) title: a single frame needs no flow control, but a
> longer message on `0x4C7` does, and this tool doesn't send it.

## Fuller test — a real title (multi-frame)

A longer string is sent as a First Frame + Consecutive Frames that must go out **in order, once per burst**. The tool can transmit them for you with correct ordering and timing:

```bash
python tools/make_test_frames.py --title "PATCH TEST" --artist "CANBUS" --send --loop 30
```

(`--send` needs the extra `PCANBasic.py` copied into `tools/` — see the software table above; without it the script prints a reminder of exactly what to install.) Without `--send` it just prints the frames so you can build a PCAN-View transmit list and trigger them in sequence — no Python API required.

---

## Reading the result

| Injected `0x4B1` shows on the cluster? | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Yes** | Flash + patch are good. If your phone's metadata still doesn't show, the issue is the **Bluetooth source**: your BT module / head unit isn't broadcasting `0x4B1`. Capture the bus (below) to confirm. |
| **No** | The flash didn't take, or the firmware version differs from what the patch targets. Re-check step 2/3 in [FLASHING.md](FLASHING.md) — the scripts abort on a byte mismatch, so a clean run means the bytes matched. |

### Checking whether your phone's metadata is on the bus

With PCAN-View **recording**, play a Bluetooth track and switch songs a couple of times. Look for **`0x4B1`** frames carrying text, e.g. `10 LL 46 12 01 01 …` (a title First Frame). 

- If you **see** them but they don't display, open an issue with a short snippet of those frames.
- If you **don't** see any `0x4B1` text, your source isn't broadcasting it. It may be using a different CAN ID — see the next section.

> Never post a full CAN log publicly — it can contain your VIN. A few `0x4B1` lines are enough.

---

## If your head unit uses a different CAN ID (experimental)

Different head units put the media metadata on **different CAN IDs** — and the forum research consistently attributes the sending to the **head unit / satnav** ("fx sends … via 1E6", "Travelpilot sends station name on 1E9", "these are only my findings with an MCA"), each using a fixed ID in its own firmware. Source: [microhacker forum t=127 "Transmitting infodata on MM-CAN"](https://microhacker.denkdose.de/viewtopic.php?t=127).

The IDs reported there, for reference:

| Info | ID(s) | Notes (per forum t=127) |
|---|---|---|
| USB titles | `4C7` | FL Mondeo with S&C |
| **Bluetooth (phone)** | `4C3`, `4C6` | |
| **Bluetooth music** | `4B0` | multiplex |
| Radiotext / nav targets | `4C1` | multiplex, MSB = index |
| Station names | `4B2`, `4B3`, `1E9` (FX/Travelpilot) | |
| Active audio source → cluster | `1E6` | |

**Which of these the cluster can actually receive** is a separate, firmware-side fact: the Convers+ acceptance table (`@0x79446`) only takes `4B1, 4B3, 4C0, 4C1, **4C6**, 4C7, 4D0, 4D2, 4D4, 4D5` (see [HOW_IT_WORKS.md §13](HOW_IT_WORKS.md)). So of the Bluetooth IDs above, **`4C6` is reachable** (and `--canid 0x4C6` can target it), but **`4C3` and `4B0` are not** — a head unit using those would need a mailbox reconfiguration this patch doesn't do. (This project's own car happens to use `4B1`, which is also in the table.)

**1. Find your ID.** Capture the bus (recording in PCAN-View), play Bluetooth and skip a couple of tracks, and look across the `0x4Bx`/`0x4Cx` range for a frame whose text changes with the track. A title frame looks like:

```
<ID>  10 LL 46 12 01 01 <first chars…>     (46 = title, 12 = Bluetooth source)
```

The `46 12 01 01` header is the tell-tale. Note the **ID** that frame arrives on.

**2. Build the patch for that ID** with `--canid`:

```bash
python tools/apply_patch_v3.py main.bin main_patched.bin --canid 0x4C6
python tools/apply_render.py  main_patched.bin main_patched.bin
```

then repack and flash as usual (see [FLASHING.md](FLASHING.md)).

### What "experimental" means here

- ✅ **Verified in the emulator:** the retargeted cave correctly reassembles and displays a frame on the new ID (e.g. `0x4C6`), and ignores others. Static analysis also confirms the patch's hook sits in the mailbox dispatch **before** any ID-based routing, so any ID the cluster accepts reaches it.
- ⚠️ **It only works for IDs the cluster already receives.** The cluster's CAN acceptance table lists: **`4B1, 4B3, 4C0, 4C1, 4C6, 4C7, 4D0, 4D2, 4D4, 4D5`**. `4C6` is on it — good, since it's one of the MCA's Bluetooth IDs. **`4C3` and `4B0` are *not*** — a head unit using those would need an extra FlexCAN mailbox reconfiguration, which this patch does not do.
- ⚠️ **Not yet confirmed on real hardware** for a non-default ID. If you try it, please report back with your car, head unit, ID and result — success or failure both help.
- The format must also match (`[field][0x12][01][01][text]`). If your capture shows a different layout, open an issue with a snippet.

> Never post a full CAN log publicly — it can contain your VIN. A few frames of the relevant ID are enough.
